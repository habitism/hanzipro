In the basic courses, we only introduce vocabulary, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. We will group words from the same field together by topic, so that you can learn Chinese more quickly.

If you can't find the topic you want to learn in the basic courses, you can send me an email. My email address is whenfung@gmail.com.

In the email you send to me, you can tell me the topic you want to learn and attach the English words you use in your daily life. I will try my best to organize them into a Chinese course.
