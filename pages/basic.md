To get started with learning Chinese, you first need to master Chinese characters.

Let me give an example:

```
kǒu
口
Mouth
```

Here, `口` is the Chinese character, and `kǒu` is the pinyin. Chinese characters are used for writing, while pinyin is used for pronunciation.

# Chinese Characters

Complex Chinese characters are composed of simpler ones. For example:

```
吹 = 口 + 欠
```

So, to quickly master most Chinese characters, you need to first learn the basic characters. I have listed about 150 basic characters. Beginners can refer to the course "The Basis of the Characters."

# Pinyin

Pinyin is divided into three parts: initial consonants, final vowels, and tones.

The initial consonant is the consonant sound at the beginning of a syllable, and the final vowel is the part that follows the initial consonant.

There are four tones in Chinese characters. Many characters have the same pronunciation but different tones, which is one of the challenges in learning Chinese characters.

Let me give an example:

```
kǒu
口
Mouth
```

Here, `k` is the initial consonant, `ou` is the final vowel, and `ǒu` indicates the third tone.
