In the practical courses, we will learn Chinese in the form of sentences. In daily life, whether it is English or Chinese, we communicate through sentences.

We will compile as many practical scenarios as possible, including areas such as movies, travel, study, and work. If you can't find the course you want to learn, you can send me an email. My email address is whenfung@gmail.com.

In the email you send to me, you can let me know the field you want to learn about and share the English sentences you use in that field. I will try my best to organize them into a Chinese course.
