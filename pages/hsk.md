The HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) is an international standardised Chinese language exam to measure the ability of non-native Chinese speakers to communicate in Chinese in daily lives, academic and working settings.

HSK vocabulary lists are collections of Chinese words and phrases that are specifically designed to help learners prepare for the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) Chinese proficiency test. These lists are categorized by HSK levels, ranging from HSK 1 to HSK 6, with each level covering a specific range of vocabulary that learners need to master.

Currently, the app includes vocabulary for HSK levels 1 to 3. We will continue to update the HSK lists and will complete all the vocabulary in the near future.
